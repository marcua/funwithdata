    "# Playing with voter data\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months ago, I read about a [voter data breach](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/us/politics/voting-records-released-privacy-concerns.html?_r=0) ([more here](http://www.databreaches.net/191-million-voters-personal-info-exposed-by-misconfigured-database/)) that resulted in 191 million voters' profiles being released on the web.  A breach like this doesn't tell people who you voted for, but it does share which elections you've voted in and how you've registered in those elections.  It also shares personal information like your phone number and mailing address, and likely any other data that a political campaign [might acquire about you from a third-party](http://www.propublica.org/article/how-companies-have-assembled-political-profiles-for-millions-of-internet-us).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where does your voter registration, election participation history, and contact information come from?  You!  When you participate in elections, states collect this information and make it available to varying degrees.  A company named NationBuilder has a list of the [state-by-state restrictions](http://nationbuilder.com/voterdata) on what one can do with voter data.  The limitations range from \"Unrestricted\" to \"Political purposes only,\" with a few instances of \"No commercial use.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Many states release the data online, and to understand the data better, I downloaded data from [North Carolina](http://www.ncsbe.gov/other-election-related-data), which provides easy and unrestricted access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this post, here's what we'll learn:\n",
    " * We'll explore voter data from North Carolina to understand what sort of voter and contact information is available to virtually anyone, presumably in all states.\n",
    " * We'll show how this data can be used for political purposes by creating a contact list of active young Democrats and active older Republicans.\n",
    " * Is there a third thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understanding the North Carolina Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I picked the North Carolina dataset because it's so easily accessible and my usage of it is unrestricted, so that I don't break any laws. I haven't looked at other states' datasets, but every article I've read on the topic suggests you can get similar data from every state.  Here's how I got the data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Go to the [North Carolina State Board of Elections election data website](http://www.ncsbe.gov/other-election-related-data).\n",
    " * Click on \"Voter Registration Data by County.\"\n",
    " * Download Alamance county's [Registration](ftp://alt.ncsbe.gov/data/ncvoter1.zip) and [History](ftp://alt.ncsbe.gov/data/ncvhis1.zip) datasets.  They are zipfiles, and you can extract a .csv (comma-separated file) from each of them.  At the bottom of the list you can download Statewide versions of each of these, but they are a few hundred megabytes each and not necessary for illustrative purposes.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll now explore some basic information about each of them, starting with the voter data.  I'll be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for my analysis and showing my work, but don't let that stop you from following along!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The voters of Alamance county\n",
    "On the next few lines, we'll open up the voter data csv and listed all of the columns in the file.  Many of them are self-explanatory, like `first_name`, `last_name`, `zip_code`, `mail_addr1`, `full_phone number`, `birth_age`, `ethnic_code`, `race_code`, or `gender_code`.  In short, you can figure out *where someone lives*, *how to contact them*, *how old they are*, and their basic *demographic information*."

    "So far, we've gotten an aggregate sense of what voter data looks like.  You can see what your neighbor's party affiliation is, or call up a random person to have a chat (please don't!).  But what makes this data powerful?  It depends who you are!  Putting our campaign hats on for a moment, imagine we wanted to find some active voters and reach out to them.  Perhaps the Democrats could find some young active voters and call them to ask for help with door-to-door campaigning in their neighborhood.  Or maybe the Republicans would want to find some active older voters to send letters asking for campaign contributions.  With a few lines of code, we can do both of these things!\n",

    "Let's start by looking for some active young Democrats.  These might be folks who are younger than 25, who have registered as Democrats and voted more than three times.  In the lines below, we filter down our dataset to young (8677 voters) who are registered Democrats (2631) that have voted (1945 times) actively (59 of these young adults).  Peaking at the `head` of this table of 59 active young Democrats, we can get their first names.  I've left out details like phone numbers or addresses for their privacy, but you can be sure that campaign organizers wouldn't: they could pick up the phone and reach out for some help."

    "What we've learned is that each state, at the very least for political purposes, makes available voter information and voting histories.  While we looked at a single county in North Carolina, it would be easy to perform the same analysis on the entire state.  There are companies dedicated to pulling down this data, cleaning it up, merging multiple states' records, and integrating other sources of information such as purchase histories, web browsing habits, and other socioeconomic markers so that campaigns can get a clear sense of who to reach out to and how to engage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we've downloaded isn't \"big data\" in any sense.  On my five-year-old laptop, I can process the queries above in less than a few seconds.  Processing the state of North Carolina would take at most a few tens of minutes without breaking too much of a sweat.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll pass no judgement on whether making this data available for political purposes is a good thing, but it's also important to highlight how else this data could be used.  Even if they aren't allowed to, non-political entities can use this data to enrich their own customer profiles.  Whereas it might annoying to be called by a campaign looking for contributions, it's scary to think about this data being readily accessibly to your bank, insurance company, or employer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that playing around with this data has given you a sense of how simple and fun it is to learn with real data.  I also hope society engages in deeper conversations about how and by whom such data should be used.  Enjoy!"
